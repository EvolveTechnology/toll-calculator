# Toll Fee Calculator 1.0

## Background

This codebase will represent the bare minimum code required to satisfy the basic requirements and unit tests. 

### Used dependencies
```xUnit```

## Running the Toll Calculator logic project.

```bash 
docker build -f Evolve.TollCalculator\Dockerfile -t tollfeecalculator . 
```
This will run the unit tests automatically, and if they fail it will fail the Docker build.
