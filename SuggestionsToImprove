Suggestions:
-Based on Business:
1. toll should be deducted based on current Day. toll fee deduction should not be allowed before or after today's date.
- Based on logic:
1. first check vehicle type. If vehicle is toll free, then no need to proceed further validations(datetime range) 
   or check free-time/Holiday.
2. Holiday list and TollFree Vehicle list, both can be externalize(configurable) same as toll Time&Fee.
3. In code fee should be tracked as double rather than integer.
